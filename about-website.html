      Sitcom Hub is a thoughtfully designed website created to celebrate and
      explore popular sitcoms that have shaped modern entertainment. The goal
      of this platform is to provide a clean, engaging, and easy-to-navigate
      space where users can discover shows, understand their appeal, and enjoy
      well-presented information without distractions.

      Built using only HTML and CSS, this website focuses on simplicity,
      performance, and visual clarity. The design emphasizes comfort and
      familiarity, much like sitcoms themselves, making the browsing experience
      smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable for all users.
